# What? <br>
We hope to increase the accessibility and exposure to reading in developing countries.<br>
<br>

# Why? <br>
Because, we strongly believe that education is a social leveller. Reading books and stories have tremendous impacts on cognitive and linguistics development which can be difficult to access for the illiterate.<br>
<br>

# How? <br>
We utilized the GPT2 language model for story generation through a simple, no-frill web application. <br>
